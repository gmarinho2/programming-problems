My solution for the leetcode problems I have solved.
### Group Anagrams
As anagrams have the same number of equal letters, for each word count how many of every letter of the alphabect it has and put that in a **vector[26]** ("a" is 0, "b" is 1 and so on). Use that as a key to a **hashmap of lists** and add this word to the specified list. Return the list of lists.
